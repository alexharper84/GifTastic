# GifTastic

I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. The web app calls the GIPHY API and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Twitter's CSS
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
* [AJAX](http://www.adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/) - Asynchronous JavaScript + XML
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - High-level, interpreted programming language.

## Getting Started

Once the page loads, be mesmerized by the Star Bridge. Once that's out of the way, press a button and enjoy the GIF avalanche.

## A line of code I'm proud of

I appended a css property to an object in the DOM using .css()
```
var p = $("<p>").text("Rating: " + rating).css("color", "white");
```


## Highlights

* Each request adds 10 more gifs to the page. Your previous GIFs are maintained.
* App is mostly mobile responsive.

## License

Take it. Use it. Tell the people.
